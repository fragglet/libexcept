libexcept is an exceptions framework for the C programming language.

C suffers from a lack of exception handling as part of the language. The 
most common way to deal with errors, for example, is for functions to 
return a status code indicating whether the function succeeded. In large 
projects, as much as 30-50% of code may be dedicated to checking status 
code values in order to deal with errors.

libexcept implements exceptions in C, providing the same kind of 
functionality that Java and other modern high-level languages provide.
